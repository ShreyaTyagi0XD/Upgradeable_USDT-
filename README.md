# Token_Upgrades

A Node.js application tailored for monitoring and recording transactions on the Avalanche Fuji C-Chain testnet. This project introduces an Upgradeable USDT smart contract, leveraging the TetherToken as the logic contract. Seamlessly combining blockchain interaction with MySQL database storage, this solution provides an efficient way to track and store transaction details. 

To run your Node.js project, you'll need to follow these steps:

*Commands:*
1. npm install
2. node database.js

*Dependencies:*

Before running the above commands, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed on your machine:

1. Node.js: Make sure Node.js is installed on your machine. You can download it from https://nodejs.org/. After running npm install, the necessary dependencies specified in your package.json file will be installed. The dependencies include:
2. express: A web application framework for Node.js.
3. mysql2: A modern MySQL library for Node.js.
4. node-fetch: A module that brings window.fetch to Node.js.
5. web3: A library for interacting with Ethereum-like blockchains.
6. Ethers: Install the ethers library using npm install ethers. This library is essential for Ethereum-related interactions in your project.

7. Hardhat: Install Hardhat using npm install hardhat. Hardhat is a development environment for Ethereum that facilitates tasks such as compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts.

Note: Ensure that your MySQL server is running and configured with the correct connection details (host, user, password, database).
